# ros2-engineering-skills

Agent skill for production-grade ROS 2 development — from first workspace to fleet deployment.

Works with [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and any agent supporting the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

## Before / After

> **Prompt:** *"My ROS 2 subscriber isn't receiving any sensor messages. Help me fix it."*

```python
# "Check your topic name and make sure
#  the publisher is running"
sub = node.create_subscription(
    Image, '/camera/image_raw',
    callback, 10)
```

Generic advice — misses the real issue.

```python
# Diagnoses QoS mismatch (DDS RxO rules):
# Sensor drivers default to BEST_EFFORT,
# but queue depth "10" implies RELIABLE.
from rclpy.qos import qos_profile_sensor_data

sub = node.create_subscription(
    Image, '/camera/image_raw',
    callback, qos_profile_sensor_data)
#          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# BEST_EFFORT + VOLATILE — matches sensor pub
```

Identifies the root cause, explains DDS Request-vs-Offered semantics, and applies the correct `qos_profile_sensor_data` preset.

## What this is

A `SKILL.md`-based knowledge module that gives AI coding agents deep ROS 2 engineering expertise. Instead of a shallow cheat sheet, it provides:

- **Decision frameworks** — when to use rclcpp vs rclpy, which QoS profile, lifecycle vs plain node
- **Progressive disclosure** — compact routing in `SKILL.md`, detailed patterns in `references/`
- **Full spectrum** — workspace setup through real-time tuning, Nav2, MoveIt 2, ros2_control, DDS configuration, cross-compilation, and CI/CD
- **Distro-aware** — explicit Humble / Jazzy / Kilted / Rolling differences with migration paths
- **Anti-pattern documentation** — what breaks in production and why

## How it differs from existing ROS 2 skills

| Aspect | Typical ROS 2 skill | This project |
|---|---|---|
| Depth | Basic QoS + lifecycle intro | DDS vendor tuning, custom executors, intra-process zero-copy, type adapters |
| Scope | Single SKILL.md file | 20 reference files via progressive disclosure |
| Hardware | Mentioned in passing | ros2_control hardware interface patterns, serial/CAN/EtherCAT, controller chaining |
| Real-time | Not covered | PREEMPT_RT, realtime_tools, memory allocation, callback group strategies |
| Simulation | Mentioned in passing | Gazebo version matrix, gz_ros2_control, Isaac Sim, sim-to-real |
| Security | Not covered | SROS2, DDS security plugins, certificate management, supply chain |
| Embedded | Not covered | micro-ROS, rclc, XRCE-DDS, ESP32/STM32/RP2040 |
| Multi-robot | Not covered | Open-RMF, fleet adapters, DDS discovery at scale, NTP/PTP sync |
| Testing | "Use pytest" | launch_testing, gtest, industrial_ci, simulation-in-the-loop CI |
| Deployment | Not covered | Docker multi-stage, cross-compile, fleet OTA, Zenoh routing |

## Current status

**Complete & Verified.** 20 reference files, 13,000+ lines of production-grade guidance, 3 utility scripts — all tested and **validated on live ROS 2 Jazzy environments.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **398 tests** | Unit + property-based (Hypothesis) + CLI + integration |
| **94% coverage** | All scripts verified with flake8 + mypy clean |
| **Real-world Evals** | **Validated empirically on WSL (Ubuntu 24.04 + ROS 2 Jazzy)** for SROS2, micro-ROS `rclc`, and Multi-robot fleet scenarios. The `eval_runner.py` performs *structural* checks on prompt/expected fixtures (keyword coverage of declared criteria); model-output quality is evaluated outside this runner. |
| **4 CI jobs** | Lint, unit-tests, ros2-integration, lint-scripts |

## Supported ROS 2 distributions

This skill is designed to work **on a complete, internally consistent ROS 2
installation**. The matrix below describes what "complete" means per distro,
and which combinations are CI-verified end-to-end.

| Distro | Status | CI verification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jazzy Jalisco** (LTS) | Primary target — recommended | Full pipeline (lint → unit → docker build → colcon test → smoke) | All scripts, scaffolds, and references default to Jazzy idioms |
| **Humble Hawksbill** (LTS) | Fully supported | Full pipeline | Distro-aware code paths handle 22.04 / older rosidl / pre-`HardwareComponentInterfaceParams` API |
| **Kilted Kaiju** (non-LTS, May 2025) | Reference-supported | Not in docker matrix (no `osrf/ros:kilted-desktop` image) | Zenoh Tier 1, EventsExecutor stable — references document the deltas |
| **Rolling Ridley** | Reference only — **not in CI** | Not gated | See **Rolling caveat** below |
| **Foxy Fitzroy** (LTS, EOL June 2023) | Migration reference only | Not built | Documented for upgrade paths only |

### Rolling caveat

`Rolling` is, by ROS 2 policy, an upstream development distribution with no
ABI guarantees. During active refactors (e.g., the ongoing `rosidl` split
into `rosidl_buffer`, `rosidl_buffer_backend`, …), `packages.ros.org`
periodically enters states where freshly-rebuilt binary `.deb` files (e.g.
`control_msgs`, `hardware_interface`) declare CMake link-interface targets
whose providing packages have not yet propagated as standalone debs. This
makes `find_package(hardware_interface)` fail at CMake generate time with
`"target was not found"` errors that cannot be resolved purely from a
downstream consumer — the broken state is upstream, in apt itself.

**That is why rolling is intentionally excluded from this project's CI
matrix.** Chasing transient upstream packaging gaps in our test pipeline
produces false negatives that have nothing to do with this skill's
correctness. We track only what we can guarantee: the LTS distros where
the binary apt repo is internally consistent.

If you want to run on rolling anyway, the canonical workarounds are:

1. **Pin apt to a known-good snapshot.** Replace `packages.ros.org/ros2/ubuntu`
   in your apt sources with a date-stamped snapshot from
   [`snapshots.ros.org`](http://snapshots.ros.org/) chosen from before the
   restructure window.
2. **Source-overlay the missing rosidl sub-packages.** Clone
   `github.com/ros2/rosidl` (and any sibling rosidl repos appearing in
   `ros2.repos`), then run `colcon build --merge-install --install-base
   /opt/ros/rolling` so source-built `Config.cmake` files supply the
   targets the binaries reference.
3. **Build `control_msgs` + `ros2_control` from source.** Their
   regenerated CMake configs will correctly call `find_dependency()` for
   whatever the current source tree depends on, eliminating the binary
   `.deb` mismatch.

For production work, **pick an LTS (Humble or Jazzy)**. Use rolling only
when you specifically need a feature that has not yet landed in an LTS,
and accept that builds may break across upstream restructures.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Please:

1. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines — add depth in `references/`
2. Include working code examples, not pseudocode
3. Document anti-patterns alongside correct patterns
4. Note which ROS 2 distros your change applies to
5. Run `flake8 scripts/ tests/` and `mypy scripts/` before submitting
6. Ensure `pytest tests/ --cov=scripts --cov-fail-under=90` passes
7. Test with at least one agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
